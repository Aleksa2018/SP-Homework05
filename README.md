# SP-Homework05

**In order to successfully complete this homework you will need to solve following tasks.
Each task solution should be given in separate Python file.**

T1. Write a Python program that outputs all possible strings formed by using thecharacters c , a , t , d , o ,and g exactlyonce.

T2. Write a Python program that can simulate a simple calculator, using the console as the exclusive input and output device. That is, each input to the calculator, be it a number, like 12.34 or 1034, or an operator, like + or =, can be done on a separate line. After each such input, you should output to the Python console what would be displayed on your calculator.

T3. Write a Python program that inputs a list of words, separated by white- space, and outputs how many times each word appears in the list.

T4. Write a Python program that inputs a document and then outputs a bar- chart plot of the frequencies of each alphabet character that appears in that document.

T5. Make abstract class `Shape` which has abstract methods `perimiter()` and `area()`. Make classes `Circle`, `Rectangle` and `Square` with required attributes and implement abstract method inherited from `Shape` class.

T6. Create class `ComplexNumber` which implements operator oveloading methods for complex numbers `(+,-,*,/)`.

T7. Implement a recursive function with signature `find(path, filename)` that reports all entries of the file system rooted at the given path having the given file name.

T8. Write a program that can solve instances of the Tower of Hanoi problem.

T9. Write a Python program for a matrix class that can add and multiply two- dimensional arrays of numbers, assuming the dimensions agree appropri- ately for the operation.

T10. Write a program that can perform the Caesar cipher for English messages that include both upper- and lowercase characters.
